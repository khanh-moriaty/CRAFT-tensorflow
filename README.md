Train:
Check your syntext dataset dir in datagen.py, and change train(False) to train(True) at last line. 
Run craft.py

text:

modify below:


    if __name__ == "__main__":
    
        train(False)
        # test('ckpt_path', 'text_image_path')

TO

    if __name__ == "__main__":
    
        # train(False)
        test('ckpt_path', 'text_image_path')

The first argument is your .ckpt path, seconed argument is text image path.

Fine-tuning:

TO DO

If you want to do this, you could use train(False), it means you load a checkpoint then training

Weak supervision:

TO DO
